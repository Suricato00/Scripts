--[[
ALL OF THE COMMANDS MUST HAVE /e BEFORE TO WORK
just like you would do an emote

example: "/e rejoin"

all of them have two variants, the long one and the short one
example: there is "rejoin" or "rj" for short

--Commands--
"AntiAfk" or "Afk" (you can go away from the computer without getting kicked)
"Rejoin" or "Rj" (Rejoins you to the same game)
"FpsBoost" or "Fps" (makes the game look super bad but its good for afk farming or if you have a trash pc)
"WalkSpeed" or "Ws" (changes your speed to the designed amount)
